Description: Implements Cox regression analysis with Multiple knockoffs for 
    variable selection in survival analysis. The package provides functions 
    for generating multiple knockoff variables, fitting null models, performing 
    association analysis, and calculating W statistics for variable selection 
    with false discovery rate control. For large-scale genetic data, the 
    optional SPACox package can be installed from GitHub for enhanced 
    performance.
