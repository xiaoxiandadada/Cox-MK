\title{Calculate W Statistics for Knockoff Analysis}
\usage{
calculate_w_statistics(Z_orig, Z_ko, method = "median")
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{Method for computing W statistics:
\itemize{
  \item "difference": W_j = T_j - max(T_\{j,k\}) (default)
  \item "median": Uses Model-X knockoff median-based statistics
  \item "ratio": W_j = T_j / max(T_\{j,k\})
}}

\item{t_orig}{Vector of test statistics for original variables}

\item{t_knock}{Vector or list of test statistics for knockoff variables.
If a list, should contain M vectors of the same length as t_orig.}
}
\value{
Vector of W statistics for variable selection
}
\description{
Computes W statistics by comparing test statistics from original variables
with those from their knockoff counterparts. These statistics are used
for variable selection with FDR control.
