\title{Calculate Model-X Knockoff Q-values by Statistics}
\usage{
mk_q_by_stat(kappa, tau, M, Rej.Bound = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{kappa}{Vector of kappa statistics indicating which variable (original or knockoff) has maximum test statistic}

\item{tau}{Vector of tau statistics representing the difference between max and median test statistics}

\item{M}{Number of knockoff copies used in the analysis}

\item{Rej.Bound}{Maximum number of rejections allowed (default: 10000)}
}
\value{
Vector of q-values for each variable
}
\description{
Calculates q-values for Model-X knockoff variable selection based on 
kappa and tau statistics. This is an internal computational function.
